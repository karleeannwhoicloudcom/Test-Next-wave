      <h2>Our Mission</h2>
      <p>At Next Wave Swim, we believe swimming is not just a sport—it's a survival skill, a confidence builder, and a lifelong joy. Our mission is to make swim instruction accessible, fun, and empowering for children and families across Miami.</p>

      <h2>How It All Started</h2>
      <p>Next Wave Swim was born from a simple but powerful realization: too many children in our community don’t have access to quality swim instruction, especially if they don’t have a pool at home. As a dedicated swim instructor with years of experience, I saw firsthand how many parents were eager to get their children swimming—but didn’t know where to start.</p>
      <p>That’s when the idea for Next Wave Swim came to life. I wanted to create a mobile, flexible swim service that brings lessons directly to families—whether in their own pools, at partner facilities, or even in public spaces during free park events. It’s all about meeting families where they are and removing the barriers that keep kids out of the water.</p>
      <p>Every lesson is designed with patience, safety, and joy in mind. At Next Wave Swim, we’re not just teaching swimming—we’re creating the next wave of confident, water-safe kids.</p>
